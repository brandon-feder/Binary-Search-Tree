# Questions:
* My makefile does not execute the code. I also don't understand what the point of it is if g++ automatically includes the necessary files. Can you create the ideal makefile for me? I would like to understand make files before cmake files even if they are better.
* In MovieTree.hpp, what is the point of line 1 and 2?
* How to I test the destructor
